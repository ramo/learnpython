Everyone has a purpose to fulfill, a passion to unleash on the world.
Whether it’s art, writing, photography, scientific knowledge, applied mathematics or patience with children, the skills you bear help better the world around you.
If you didn’t have a purpose, you wouldn’t be here.
I cannot tell you what your purpose is — it is something that has to be discovered within yourself.
What keeps you awake at night? What do you do to procrastinate? Finding your skills and passions help release your purpose into a world that is thirsty for it.
While life gives us many reasons to be sad, it gives even more to dance.
This season, celebrate your wonderful life and all the uniqueness that it brings.
